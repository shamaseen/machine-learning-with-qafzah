## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up your environment and run the notebooks.

### 1. Install Git
If you donâ€™t have Git installed, follow the instructions below:

#### For macOS/Linux:
- Open the terminal and type:
    ```
    git --version
    ```
    If Git is installed, you'll see the version number. If not, install Git by following these steps:
    - On macOS, install Git via Homebrew by running:
        ```
        brew install git
        ```
    - On Linux, use your package manager, for example:
        ```
        sudo apt-get install git
        ```

#### For Windows:
- Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and type:
    ```
    git --version
    ```
    If Git is not installed, download it from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the installation instructions.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Once Git is installed, clone the repository:

#### For macOS/Linux:
- Open the terminal and run:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-with-qafzah.git
    cd machine-learning-with-qafzah
    ```

#### For Windows:
- Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-with-qafzah.git
    cd machine-learning-with-qafzah
    ```

### 3. Make Sure You Have Python 3.10 Installed
Check if Python 3.10 is installed:

#### For macOS/Linux:
- Open the terminal and type:
    ```
    python3 -V
    ```
    If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### For Windows:
- Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and type:
    ```
    python -V
    ```
    If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 4. Create a Virtual Environment

#### For macOS/Linux:
1. Create the environment:
    ```
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

2. Activate the environment:
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### For Windows:
1. Create the environment:
    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```

2. Activate the environment:
    ```
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 5. Running Notebooks in VS Code

Make sure you have the **Python extension** for VS Code installed, which will allow you to run Jupyter notebooks directly within VS Code.

1. Open VS Code and navigate to the cloned repository.
2. Install the **Python extension** from the VS Code Marketplace.
3. Open the desired notebook (`.ipynb` file), and you'll be able to run it within VS Code.
